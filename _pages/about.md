I’m a technical architect who has made a drastic career shift to Data Science. I've been motivated by the potential of this field to improve our lives on many levels. It’s been a while since I started applying my knowledge to both personal and professional projects. I look forward to meet new challenges and improve my skills.

## Current interests:
+ Data Science
+ Sustainability
+ Energy and Urban Planning

<!-- I'm eager to learn and I want to make a good use of my aquired skills in any type of project. -->
