One of my main features is that **I do love learning**. I don't say it as a banality, I mean it. Learning new things is in my top 3 of things that I love to do the most. I consider myself good at it.

That was what lead me to make a drastic career shift towards Data Science from a background in Architecture. It may seem unconnected, but in the end, most of the work that I've done in my (brief) career has been related to data somehow.

By now, I'm proud to have been capable of learning by myself most of the things that it takes to be a Data Scientist. However, in line with one of my _late-motives_, I keep studying, now in a more formal way.

My current interests, and mostly the things that guide my lifetime projects are **Data Science** and the things that it involve, like statistics and math, but also I'm passionate about **Sustainability**. The job that I'd love to have would be related to both fields. In the meantime, I'll keep working to achieve it!
