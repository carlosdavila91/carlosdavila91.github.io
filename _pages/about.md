One of my main features is that **I do love learning**. I don't say it carelessly. I mean it. Learning new things is in my top 3 of things that I love to do the most. I consider myself good at it and I'm doing it constantly.

That was what lead me to make a career shift towards Data Science from a background in Architecture. It may seem unconnected, but in the end, all of my experience and education is related to data somehow.

By now, I'm proud to have been capable of learning by myself most of the things that it takes to be a Data Analyst or Scientist. However, in line with one of my _late-motives_, I keep educating myself.

My current interests, and mostly the things that guide my lifetime projects now are **Data Analysis and Science** and things like statistics and math. But also I'm passionate about **Sustainability**. The job that I'd love to have would be related to both fields. In the meantime, I'll keep working to achieve it!
