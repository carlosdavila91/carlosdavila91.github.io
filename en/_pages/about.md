👋Welcome!

My name is Carlos Dávila. I'm a Data Scientist with two years of experience doing 📊**Data Analysis** and 📈 **Data Science**.

I made a career transition from a background in Technical Architecture to this fascinating field. I'm also very into 🌍**Sustainability**.

You'll find some notes about my learning journey in my blog.
