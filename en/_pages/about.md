ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

My name is Carlos DÃ¡vila and I'm currently a Data Consultant.

I made a career transition from a background in Technical Architecture to Data Science. It may seem unconnected, but along the way, all of my experience and recent training have been related to data.

I believe that the things that lead me to follow this path are the willingness to learn, motivation, be open-minded and tons of patience to deal with errors in code.

I do **Data Science and Analysis**. Also, I'm very into **Sustainability**.

You can find some notes about my learning journey and some thoughts in my blog.
