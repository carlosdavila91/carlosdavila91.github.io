Work experience
======
**Freelancer Data Consultant** (jul'20 &mdash; today)

I'm offering my services as Data Science Consultant. So far I've worked for a retail company to deliver valuable data reports and I've made statistical advising for an academic investigation related to Carbon Dioxide Emissions.

**Data Science Intern at Pagantis** (oct'19 &mdash; mar'20)

I worked across the board between the Data Science and Business Intelligence departments. I helped developing tools to automate the data analysis process, like `shiny` dashboards and the company's `R` package. I also carry out **adjustments in the hyperparameters of the models in production to improve their performance** according to the results of the analyses.

**Technical Consultant at Ciclica** (nov'18 &mdash; may'19)

To manage data from the [Efficient Household Program](https://www.viladecans.cat/es/programa-hogar-eficiente-punto-de-empezar), I built a database from scratch with `R` and `Excel`, to make data accessible to non programming members of the team. Besides, I automated the production of personalized reports for each volunteer of the Program in each session. I also engaged in the definition of the content of the sessions and helped explaining some concepts to the participants.

**Research Intern at Ciclica** (mar'18 &mdash; sep'18)

Research into economically viable scenarios for reducing CO2 emissions from a household, as part of the Vilawatt project.

**Research Assistant at UPC** (feb'17 &mdash; jul'17)

Campuslab, drafting the Action Plan. This was an Action Research Project to turn the UPC into a living laboratory in which to encourage synergies between students, administrative and teaching staff.
